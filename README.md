# MSFNet-CPD: Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network for Crop Pest Detection
This work has been accepted by IJCNN2025.
# Abstract
Identifying pests is critical to agricultural productivity but challenging due to the variety of pest species. Although deep learning techniques have been widely applied to pest detection, most existing methods rely solely on low-level image features and fail to integrate multimodal data, limiting accuracy and interpretability. The lack of comprehensive multimodal datasets in agriculture exacerbates this problem. This paper constructs two multimodal datasets, CTIP102 and STIP102, based on the IP102 dataset and proposes a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for crop pest detection. Our method enhances image quality by using super-resolution reconstruction. Combining original and reconstructed images as inputs improves image clarity and detection accuracy. The Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module strengthens the robustness of the model by integrating visual and text features. The Image-Text Converter (ITC) also recovers fine-grained image details through multi-scale reconstruction, improving performance in complex environments. To further enhance the network's effectiveness, we introduce the Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) method, which improves the model's adaptability to real-world environments by generating a multi-target detection dataset, MTIP102. The experimental results show that MSFNet-CPD outperforms existing methods in agricultural pest detection, demonstrating its effectiveness.
